# Development Rules & Best Practices

## Core Principles

1. **Keep It Simple (KISS)**
   - Don't over-engineer solutions
   - Use simple, straightforward approaches
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Prefer built-in solutions over custom implementations

2. **UI/UX Best Practices**
   - Clean, modern design with proper spacing
   - Consistent color scheme and typography
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)
   - Responsive design (mobile-first)

3. **Code Quality**
   - One responsibility per component/function
   - Meaningful variable and function names
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Proper error handling

4. **Performance**
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Debounce/throttle expensive operations
   - Lazy load when appropriate
   - Optimize re-renders

5. **Security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before rendering
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Regular dependency audits

6. **Commits**
   - One-line conventional commits
   - Format: `type(scope): subject`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Max 72 characters

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Use modern color palette (slate/gray tones)
- Subtle shadows and borders for depth
- Gradient buttons for primary actions
- Hover states on all interactive elements
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)
- Proper spacing (8px grid system)
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
